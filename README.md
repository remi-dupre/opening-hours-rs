**üêç Python bindings can be found [here](https://github.com/remi-dupre/opening-hours-rs/tree/master/opening-hours-py)**

A Rust library for parsing and working with OSM's opening hours field. You can
find its specification [here][grammar] and the reference JS library
[here](https://github.com/opening-hours/opening_hours.js).

Note that the specification is quite messy and that the JS library takes
liberty to extend it quite a lot. This means that most of the real world data
don't actually comply to the very restrictive grammar detailed in the official
specification. This library tries to fit with the real world data while
remaining as close as possible to the core specification.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
opening-hours = "2"
```

Here's a simple example that parse an opening hours description and displays
its current status and date for next change:

```rust
use chrono::Local;
use opening_hours::OpeningHours;

// Opens until 18pm during the week and until 12am the week-end.
const OH: &str = "Mo-Fr 10:00-18:00; Sa-Su 10:00-12:00";

fn main() {
    let oh: OpeningHours = OH.parse().unwrap();
    let date = Local::now().naive_local();
    println!("Current status is {:?}", oh.state(date));
    println!("This will change at {:?}", oh.next_change(date).unwrap());
}
```

## Supported features

- üìù Parsing for [OSM opening hours][grammar]
- üßÆ Evaluation of state and next change
- ‚è≥ Lazy infinite iterator
- üåÖ Accurate sun events
- üìÖ Embedded public holidays database for many countries (from [nager])
- üåç Timezone support
- üî• Fast and memory-safe implementation using Rust

### Holidays

A public holiday database is loaded using [nager]. You can refer to their
website for more detail on supported country or if you want to contribute.

If you enable the **auto-country** feature, you can automatically detect the
country of a point of interest from its coordinate.

### Syntax

If you are only interested in parsing expressions but not on the evaluation or
if you want to build your own evaluation engine, you should probably rely on
the [opening-hours-syntax] crate.

### Timezone

You can attach the timezone of the POI corresponding to your opening hours in
the evaluation context. If you enable the **auto-timezone** feature, you can
also automatically infer the timezone from coordinates.

### Logging

The **log** feature can be enabled to emit warnings the [crate-log] crate.

## Limitations

Expressions will always be considered closed **before 1900 and after 9999**.
This comes from the specification not supporting date outside of this grammar
and makes the implementation slightly more convenient.

Feel free to open an issue if you have a use case for extreme dates!

## Contributing

### Running tests

Tests can be run by running `cargo test`.

A fuzzing can be run using _cargo-fuzz_ by running
`cargo +nightly fuzz run -j 4 parse_oh`.

### Re-generating Python stub file

_opening_hours.pyi_ should not be edited manually, if you make changes to
Python bindings, you need to update it automatically:

```bash
# Install required dev dependencies
poetry install --with dev

# Generate stub file
cd opening-hours-py
cargo run --bin stub_gen
